# freeCodeCamp Homework

> Repo dedicated to documenting all the exercises developed as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum, including commentary on each one of the exercises, challenges faced, and areas for improvement within each project.

## Quick Start

1. Read and ask questions. There's nothing to do here besides that, at least for now

## To-Do

1. Develop GitHub pages based on the exercises. Supporting documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site // https://pages.github.com/
2. Adjust file naming convention from kebab case to snake case (from beginning all the way to 3.4)
