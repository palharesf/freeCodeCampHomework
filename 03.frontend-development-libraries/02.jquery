<!-- To add jQuery, first add a script element at the top of the page and close it on the following line. Inside the script element, add this code: $(document).ready(function() { to your script. Then close it on the following line (still inside your script element) with: }); We'll learn more about functions later. The important thing to know is that code you put inside this function will run as soon as your browser has loaded your page. This is important because without your document ready function, your code may run before your HTML is rendered, which would cause bugs -->
<!-- All jQuery functions start with a $, usually referred to as a dollar sign operator, or as bling. jQuery often selects an HTML element with a selector, then does something to that element -->
<!-- The three common ways to target elements are: by type: $("button"), by class: $(".btn"), and by id $("#target1") -->
<!-- In the same way you can add classes to an element with jQuery's addClass() function, you can remove them with jQuery's removeClass() function -->
<!-- We can also change the CSS of an HTML element directly with jQuery. It has a function called .css() that allows you to change the CSS of an element -->
<!-- You can also change the non-CSS properties of HTML elements with jQuery. For example, you can disable buttons. When you disable a button, it will become grayed-out and can no longer be clicked. It uses a function called .prop() that allows you to adjust the properties of elements -->
<!-- jQuery has a function called .html() that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element. Any content previously within the element will be completely replaced with the content you provide using this function. jQuery also has a similar function called .text() that only alters text without adding tags. In other words, this function will not evaluate any HTML tags passed to it, but will instead treat it as the text you want to replace the existing content with -->
<!-- jQuery has a function called .remove() that will remove an HTML element entirely. It also has a function called appendTo() that allows you to select HTML elements and append them to another element. It also has a function called clone() that makes a copy of an element -->
<!-- jQuery has a function called parent() that allows you to access the parent of whichever element you've selected. Similarly, it has a function called children() that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected -->
<!-- jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. The target:nth-child(n) CSS selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type. You can also target elements based on their positions using :odd or :even selectors -->

  $(document).ready(function() {
