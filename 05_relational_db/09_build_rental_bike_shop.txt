When a user enters an option at the main menu, you want to take them to the appropriate sub-menu. You can use a case statement for this. Here's an example:

    case EXPRESSION in
    PATTERN) STATEMENTS ;;
    PATTERN) STATEMENTS ;;
    PATTERN) STATEMENTS ;;
    *) STATEMENTS ;;
    esac

For example, if we're expecting the user to select options 1, 2, or 3 to access sub-menus via an input ($MAIN_MENU_SELECTION), we can write the case statement like this:

    case $MAIN_MENU_SELECTION in
        1) RENT_MENU ;;
        2) RETURN_MENU ;;
        3) EXIT ;;
        *) MAIN_MENU ;;
    esac

The *) case is, naturally, the wildcard option

What you put in a subshell ($(...)) will be executed, and the result of it will replace the subshell.
For instance, if I want to take an echo command and some code to format it, I could have the following block:

    #original echo command with formatting options:
    echo $BIKE_INFO | sed 's/ |/"/'
    #subshell
    BIKE_INFO_FORMATTED=$(echo $BIKE_INFO | sed 's/ |/"/')
