MongoDB is a database application that stores JSON documents (or records) that you can use in your application. 
Unlike SQL, another type of database, MongoDB is a non-relational or "NoSQL" database. 
This means MongoDB stores all associated data within one record, instead of storing it across many preset tables as in a SQL database.

Mongoose is a popular npm package for interacting with MongoDB. 
With Mongoose, you can use plain JavaScript objects instead of JSON, which makes it easier to work with MongoDB. 
Also, it allows you to create blueprints for your documents called schemas, so you don't accidentally save the wrong type of data and cause bugs later.
