Dependencies:

The package.json file is the center of any Node.js project or npm package. It stores information about your project.
It consists of a single JSON object where information is stored in key-value pairs.
There are only two required fields; name and version, but it’s good practice to provide additional information.

You can create the package.json file from the terminal using the
    npm init
command. This will run a guided setup. Using npm init with the -y flag will generate the file without having it ask any questions, 
    npm init -y

If you look at the file tree of your project, you will find the package.json file on the top level of the tree.
This is the file that you will be improving in the next couple of challenges.

One of the most common pieces of information in this file is the author field.
It specifies who created the project, and can consist of a string or an object with contact or other details.
An object is recommended for bigger projects, but a simple string like the following example will do for this project.

    "author": "Jane Doe",

The next part of a good package.json file is the description field; where a short, but informative description about your project belongs.

If some day you plan to publish a package to npm, this is the string that should sell your idea to the user when they decide whether to install your package or not.
However, that’s not the only use case for the description, it’s a great way to summarize what a project does.
It’s just as important in any Node.js project to help other developers, future maintainers or even your future self understand the project quickly.

Regardless of what you plan for your project, a description is definitely recommended.

    "description": "A project that does something awesome",

The keywords field is where you can describe your project using related keywords.

    "keywords": [ "descriptive", "related", "words" ],

As you can see, this field is structured as an array of double-quoted strings.
The license field is where you inform users of what they are allowed to do with your project.
Some common licenses for open source projects include MIT and BSD. License information is not required, and copyright laws in most countries will give you ownership of what you create by default.
However, it’s always a good practice to explicitly state what users can and can’t do. Here's an example of the license field:

    "license": "MIT",

A version is one of the required fields of your package.json file. This field describes the current version of your project.

    "version": "1.2.0",
