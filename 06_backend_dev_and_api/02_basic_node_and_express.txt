Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in JavaScript.
Node.js comes with a handful of built-in modules — small, independent programs — that help with this.
Some of the core modules include HTTP, which acts like a server, and File System, a module to read and modify files.

Express is a lightweight web application framework, and is one of the most popular packages on npm.
Express makes it much easier to create a server and handle routing for your application, which handles things like directing people to the correct page when they visit a certain endpoint like /blog.

Node is just a JavaScript environment. Like client side JavaScript, you can use the console to display useful debug information.
It is recommended to keep the terminal open during development. By reading the output in the terminal, you can see any errors that may occur.
The server must be restarted after making changes to its files.
If the server is stopped (Ctrl + C), you can start it using Node directly (node mainEntryFile.js) or using a run script in the package.json file with npm run.

For example, the "start": "node server.js" script would be run from the terminal using 
    npm run start
To implement server auto restarting on file save Node provides the --watch flag you can add to your start script 
    "start": "node --watch server.js"
or you can install an npm package like nodemon
