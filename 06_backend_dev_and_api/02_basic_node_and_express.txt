Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in JavaScript. Node.js comes with a handful of built-in modules — small, independent programs — that help with this. Some of the core modules include HTTP, which acts like a server, and File System, a module to read and modify files.

In the last set of courses you learned to install and manage packages from npm, which are collections of smaller modules. These packages can help you build larger, more complex applications.

Express is a lightweight web application framework, and is one of the most popular packages on npm. Express makes it much easier to create a server and handle routing for your application, which handles things like directing people to the correct page when they visit a certain endpoint like

/blog

.

In this course, you'll learn the basics of Node and Express including how to create a server, serve different files, and handle different requests from the browser.
