Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in JavaScript.
Node.js comes with a handful of built-in modules — small, independent programs — that help with this.
Some of the core modules include HTTP, which acts like a server, and File System, a module to read and modify files.

Express is a lightweight web application framework, and is one of the most popular packages on npm.
Express makes it much easier to create a server and handle routing for your application, which handles things like directing people to the correct page when they visit a certain endpoint like /blog.
