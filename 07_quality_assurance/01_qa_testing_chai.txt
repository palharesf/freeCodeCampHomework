In Chai, there are several unit tests one can configure:
- #isNull vs #isNotNull, where only 'null' will trigger the #isNull condition, whereas anything else will trigger the #isNotNull condition;
- #isDefined vs #isUndefined, where only 'undefined' is undefined, and anything else (including 'null') is defined;
- #isOk vs #isNotOk, where truthy values are okay, and falsey values are not ok;
- #isTrue vs #isNotTrue, where only truthy boolean values are true, whereas truthy non-boolean values (e.g. objects) are not true in this definition;

- equal() compares objects using '==', and the result can be tested with #equal and #notEqual;
- strictEqual() compares objects using ===, and the result can be tested with #strictEqual and #notStrictEqual;
- deepEqual() asserts that two objects are deep equal, and the result can be tested with #deepEqual and #notDeepEqual';

- Numerical comparisons can use the operators '#isAbove, #isAtMost, #isBelow, #isAtLeast, and #approximately';
- For .approximately, the syntax is :
    .approximately(actual, expected, delta, [message])
    where we assert that the actual is equal to expected, to within a +/- delta range

- For Arrays, we have tests for data type (#isArray, #isNotArray) and for content (Array #include, #notInclude);

- For Strings, we have tests for data type (#isString, #isNotString), content (String #include, #notInclude) and Regex matching (#match, #notMatch);

- For Objects, we have tests for existence (or absence) of properties (#property, #notProperty), type (#typeOf, #notTypeOf), and hierarchy (#instanceOf, #notInstanceOf);
