In Chai, there are several tests one can configure:
- #isNull vs #isNotNull, where only 'null' will trigger the #isNull condition, whereas anything else will trigger the #isNotNull condition;
- #isDefined vs #isUndefined, where only 'undefined' is undefined, and anything else (including 'null') is defined;
- #isOk vs #isNotOk, where truthy values are okay, and falsey values are not ok;
- #isTrue vs #isNotTrue, where only truthy boolean values are true, whereas truthy non-boolean values (e.g. objects) are not true in this definition;

- equal() compares objects using '==', and the result can be tested with #equal and #notEqual;
- strictEqual() compares objects using ===, and the result can be tested with #strictEqual and #notStrictEqual;
- deepEqual() asserts that two objects are deep equal, and the result can be tested with #deepEqual and #notDeepEqual';
