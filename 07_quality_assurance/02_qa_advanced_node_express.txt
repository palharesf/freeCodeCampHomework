A template engine enables you to use static template files (such as those written in Pug) in your app.
At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values which can be supplied by your server.
Then it transforms the template into a static HTML file that is sent to the client.
This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page and allows for displaying variables on the page without needing to make an API call from the client.
